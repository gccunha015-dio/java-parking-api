# Java Parking API
## Observations
As I use the Starter Plan of **Railway.app**, my account has limited usage per month.

For this reason I disabled the deployment, if you want to test the API, create an [Issue](https://github.com/gccunha015-dio/java-parking-api/issues/new) telling me that you want to test it, and I will enable it for 24h when I see your issue.

## About

Created with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, built with **Maven**, data persisted with **PostgreSQL** and deployed on **Railway.app**.
